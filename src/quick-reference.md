## Decision Tree

Choose a pattern based on your need:

### I need to create objects efficiently

→ **Singleton** (single instance) or **Factory Method** (multiple types) or **Builder** (complex construction)

### I need to work with existing objects differently

→ **Adapter** (incompatible interfaces) or **Decorator** (add behavior) or **Proxy** (control access)

### I need to organize complex structures

→ **Composite** (hierarchies) or **Facade** (simplify subsystems)

### I need to handle events and notifications

→ **Observer** (one-to-many) or **Chain of Responsibility** (sequential handlers) or **Mediator** (centralized)

### I need to manage state and behavior changes

→ **State** (internal state) or **Strategy** (algorithm switching) or **Template Method** (algorithm skeleton)

### I need to handle concurrency

→ **Producer-Consumer** (decoupled), **Scheduler** (resource control), or **Read-Write Lock** (concurrent access)

### I need to structure my application

→ **MVC** (web), **MVP** (testing), **MVVM** (data binding), or **Repository** (data access)

## Pattern Relationships

### Patterns that work together:

- **Factory Method** + **Template Method**
- **Abstract Factory** + **Factory Method**
- **Composite** + **Iterator** + **Visitor**
- **Decorator** + **Strategy** + **State**
- **Repository** + **Factory Method** + **Singleton**
- **MVC** + **Observer** + **Strategy**
- **Dependency Injection** + **Singleton** + **Factory Method**

## By Use Case

## Performance Considerations

**Potentially Expensive:**

- Prototype (deep cloning)
- Composite (tree traversal)
- Visitor (multiple traversals)
- Read-Write Lock (lock overhead)

**Generally Lightweight:**

- Singleton
- Strategy
- Decorator
- Proxy (unless lazy-loading)

## Testing Considerations

**Easy to Test:**

- Strategy
- Template Method
- Dependency Injection
- Factory Method

**Challenging to Test:**

- Singleton (tight coupling)
- Service Locator
- Static methods

## Common Mistakes

| Pattern   | Common Mistake                   | Solution                   |
| --------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Singleton | Creates tight coupling           | Use Dependency Injection   |
| Observer  | Memory leaks from unsubscription | Always unsubscribe         |
| Composite | Treating leaves as nodes         | Use proper type hierarchy  |
| Decorator | Order dependency                 | Ensure composability       |
| Factory   | Hardcoding types                 | Use reflection or registry |
| Strategy  | Too many tiny strategies         | Combine related strategies |
| State     | State explosion                  | Group related states       |
